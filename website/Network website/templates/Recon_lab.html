    <p>
      Cybersecurity reconnaissance is the process of gathering detailed information about a target system, network, or organization
      in order to identify potential vulnerabilities. It is the foundational step for many security assessments and penetration tests.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reconnaissance is generally classified into:
      <strong>Passive Reconnaissance</strong> – collecting publicly available data without directly engaging the target; and 
      <strong>Active Reconnaissance</strong> – directly engaging with the target using scans and probes, though at a higher risk of detection.
    </p>
    <h3>How Reconnaissance Works</h3>
    <h3>1. Determine the Scope of the Target Network</h3>
    <p>
      Attackers begin by researching the target to understand its size—identifying the IP range and deciding whether to target the entire network
      or just a specific subnet. This helps define the area that will be monitored.
    </p>
    <h3>2. Locate Open Ports &amp; Access Points</h3>
    <p>
      Next, attackers scan for open ports and identify weak access points, such as unsecured endpoints or IoT devices.
    </p>
    <h3>3. Identify Services on the Ports</h3>
    <p>
      After identifying open ports, the attacker determines the services running on them. This step helps in planning further exploitation.
    </p>
    <h3>4. Map the Network</h3>
    <p>
      Creating a network map — detailing routers, firewalls, subnets, and endpoints — provides a visualization of the network infrastructure,
      helping to identify critical assets.
    </p>
    <h3>5. Avoid Detection</h3>
    <p>
      Throughout reconnaissance, attackers use stealth techniques (e.g., spreading out scan requests) to avoid triggering security systems.

      In this section, you will perform a series of reconnaissance tasks using a network scanning tool (nmap).
    </p>
    <div class="task-instructions">
      <h3>Task 1: Host Discovery</h3>
      <p>Scan the target network (e.g., 192.168.200.0/24) to determine how many IP addresses are active.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="task-instructions">
      <h3>Task 2: Port Scanning</h3>
      <p>Select an active host and perform a port scan to identify open ports and running services.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="task-instructions">
      <h3>Task 3: OS Detection</h3>
      <p>Conduct an OS detection scan on a target host to determine its operating system and version.</p>

      <p>During reconnaissance, unencrypted services can leak sensitive information. 
        In this exercise, you will perform a Telnet login between two victim machines and use Wireshark to find the credentials.</p>
        <p>On Victim A, start a Telnet session to Victim B: </p>
        <p>telnet 192.168.200.11 </p>

      To protect against reconnaissance, organizations can implement strategies such as network segmentation, deploying honeypots,
      using Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS), and continuously monitoring network traffic.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Network Segmentation:</strong> Dividing the network into smaller segments to limit an attacker's movement.</li>
      <li><strong>Honeypots:</strong> Deploying decoy systems to lure attackers away from critical assets.</li>
      <li><strong>Intrusion Detection:</strong> Setting up systems like Snort to detect reconnaissance activity.</li>
      <li><strong>Continuous Monitoring:</strong> Regularly reviewing logs and network traffic for suspicious patterns.</li>
      <li><strong>User Training:</strong> Educating staff about security best practices and social engineering risks.</li>
