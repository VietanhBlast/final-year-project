    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>
      The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is one of the foundational protocols of the Internet, designed for reliable, ordered communication.
      However, TCP lacks built-in security mechanisms, making it vulnerable to various attacks where packets can be forged or sessions manipulated.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this lab, students will explore two serious attacks against TCP sessions:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>TCP Reset Attack:</strong> Abruptly terminating a TCP session by injecting forged RST packets.</li>
      <li><strong>Reverse Shell Injection Attack:</strong> Injecting commands into an active Telnet session to create a reverse shell back to the attacker.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Objective</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Perform a TCP Reset Attack to forcibly terminate an active Telnet session.</li>
      <li>Perform a Reverse Shell Injection Attack by injecting malicious payloads into a Telnet session.</li>
      <li>Understand how TCP’s lack of authentication for packet origin allows session manipulation.</li>
      <li>Observe the dangers of unencrypted, unauthenticated communication protocols.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Attack Scenarios</h3>
    <h4>1. TCP Reset Attack:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Inject a TCP packet with the RST flag set to force a victim’s Telnet connection to terminate unexpectedly.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>2. Reverse Shell Injection via Telnet:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Inject specially crafted packets into an existing Telnet session to execute a reverse shell command, connecting the victim's system back to the attacker.</li>
    </ul>

      <span class="arrow-icon">&#9656;</span>
    </summary>
    <div class="task-content">
      <h3>Important Note:</h3>
      <p>
        In this lab, we only explain detection and defense mechanisms. We are not deploying Snort yet.
        IDS deployment will be performed later in the dedicated IDS Lab.
      </p>
  
      <h3>Detection:</h3>
      <h4>Detecting TCP Reset Attacks:</h4>
      <p>
        Snort can detect suspicious TCP Reset (RST) activity by monitoring abnormal RST packets in established sessions.
        Detection strategies include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Alerting when an RST packet is seen in a TCP session that is not closing naturally.</li>
        <li>Detecting a high frequency of RST packets coming from unexpected sources.</li>
        <li>Identifying RST packets with sequence numbers that do not match the expected session sequence.</li>
      </ul>
  
      <h4>Detecting Reverse Shell Injection:</h4>
      <p>
        Reverse shell attacks typically generate unexpected outbound connections from internal hosts to attacker-controlled IP addresses.
        Detection strategies include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Monitoring outbound TCP connections on unusual ports (e.g., high-numbered ports).</li>
        <li>Alerting on Telnet traffic carrying suspicious command patterns, such as bash -i or /dev/tcp/.</li>
        <li>Detecting command injection attempts inside unencrypted Telnet sessions.</li>
      </ul>
  
      <h3>Defending Against TCP Reset Attacks:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Use Encrypted Protocols:</strong> Use SSH instead of Telnet to secure sessions. SSH uses encryption and authentication, making RST injection very difficult.</li>
        <li><strong>TCP Session Hardening:</strong> Systems and applications can be configured to ignore unexpected RST packets unless they meet strict criteria (e.g., correct sequence numbers).</li>
        <li><strong>Session Monitoring:</strong> Deploy tools that monitor TCP state transitions to detect abnormal session terminations.</li>
        <li><strong>IDS/IPS Systems:</strong> Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) can automatically drop forged RST packets identified by Snort or similar tools.</li>
      </ul>
  
      <h3>Defending Against Reverse Shell Injection:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Strict Egress Filtering:</strong> Use firewalls to restrict outbound traffic, preventing victims from connecting to unknown external IP addresses.</li>
        <li><strong>Encrypted and Authenticated Sessions:</strong> Enforce the use of SSH for remote management instead of unprotected Telnet.</li>
        <li><strong>Command Inspection in Telnet:</strong> Monitor Telnet traffic (if it must be used) for suspicious commands being sent, and trigger alerts on detection.</li>
        <li><strong>Segmentation and Least Privilege:</strong> Ensure internal machines have limited outbound network access and run services with minimal privileges.</li>
        <li><strong>Real-Time Alerting:</strong> Set up IDS alerts for command injection patterns and suspicious outbound connections.</li>
      </ul>
