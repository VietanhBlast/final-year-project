    <!-- Introduction -->
    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>
      Welcome to the Network Attack Simulation for training. This project provides an isolated environment for learning and 
      performing common network attacks and at a later stage, you can learn how they can be detected and mitigated. By working 
      through the labs, users will experience both the offensive and defensive sides of network security, gaining critical insight 
      into how attackers operate and how defenders can protect their systems.
    </p>
    <p>
      The labs simulate realistic network scenarios, allowing users to explore vulnerabilities, craft custom network packets, 
      intercept communications, and implement IDS rules.
    </p>

    <!-- About This Project -->
    <h3>About This Project</h3>
    <p>
      This project focuses on teaching the fundamental concepts of network attack. It covers a series of common network attacks including:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Intro to Scapy and how to use Wireshark/Edgeshark on Docker containers</li>
      <li>Reconnaissance and Service Enumeration using Nmap</li>
      <li>ARP Cache Poisoning and Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks</li>
      <li>Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks through SYN and TCP Flooding</li>
      <li>TCP Reset Attack to Disrupt Active Connections</li>
      <li>Reverse Shell Injection into Active Telnet Sessions</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Users will utilize Scapy to craft custom packets and simulate attacks, and Wireshark to capture and analyze network traffic.
      Finally, defensive users will learn how to deploy Snort, a powerful Intrusion Detection System (IDS), to detect these attacks.
    </p>
    <p>
      The labs are designed to provide a complete learning experience—from launching attacks, to analyzing network traffic, 
      to detecting them using IDS, and finally learning how to defend against them.
    </p>
    <p>
      There will also be a final “Challenges” page offering additional tasks for users who want to further practice their skills.
    </p>

    <!-- Learning Objectives -->
    <h3>Learning Objectives</h3>

      <li>Gain practical experience crafting packets and simulating attacks using Scapy.</li>
      <li>Develop skills in network traffic analysis using Wireshark.</li>
      <li>Learn how to detect common attacks using Snort and IDS rule creation.</li>
      <li>Explore defense strategies such as static ARP entries, firewalls, and segmentation.</li>
      <li>Understand the importance of proactive monitoring and defense in modern network security.</li>
    </ul>

  <h3>Lab Setup and Configuration</h3>
  <p>This section provides commands to set up your Docker containers for the security lab. Execute these commands in your terminal to start the required containers:</p>

  <div class="task-instructions">
    <h4>Docker Commands to Set Up Containers</h4>
    <pre>
docker run -dit --name victimA --network lab-net --ip 192.168.200.10 myvictimaimage:v2a
docker run -dit --name victimB --network lab-net --ip 192.168.200.11 victimbimage:v2b
docker run -dit --name attacker --network lab-net --ip 192.168.200.100 --privileged attackerimage:v2
docker run -dit --name hostattacker --network host --cap-add=NET_ADMIN --cap-add=NET_RAW hostattackerimage:v2
    </pre>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="task-box">
  <h3>Network Setup Commands</h3>
  <p>Run these commands to set up the network and configure the containers with appropriate permissions and IPs. Ensure the Docker network 'lab-net' is created before running these commands:</p>
  <div class="task-instructions">
    <h4>Set Up Docker Containers with Specific IPs</h4>
    <pre>
docker network create --subnet=192.168.200.0/24 lab-net
docker run -dit --name victimA --network lab-net --ip 192.168.200.10 myvictimaimage:v2a
docker run -dit --name victimB --network lab-net --ip 192.168.200.11 victimbimage:v2b
docker run -dit --name attacker --network lab-net --ip 192.168.200.100 --privileged attackerimage:v2
docker run -dit --name hostattacker --network host --cap-add=NET_ADMIN --cap-add=NET_RAW hostattackerimage:v2
